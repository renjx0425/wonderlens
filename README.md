**Fostering Empathy Through Interactive Character Perspective-Taking**  

![WonderLens Banner](./images/canvas.png)  

## 📌 Overview  
**WonderLens** is an innovative interactive reading tool that transforms traditional third-person narratives into immersive **first-person** experiences. By allowing readers to explore **parallel first-person perspectives**, it fosters **empathy**, **engagement**, and a deeper **cognitive connection** to the characters.  

The project is inspired by **R.J. Palacio’s "Wonder"**, helping readers experience narratives through different **character viewpoints**, making storytelling more immersive and educational.  

## 🚀 Features  
- 🧠 **Parallel Narrative Exploration** – Compare perspectives of different characters side by side.  
- 😊 **Emotion Tagging** – Drag and drop emotions to key story moments.  
- 💬 **Reflective Prompts** – Engage in thought-provoking questions to enhance perspective-taking.  
- 🎭 **Choice-Driven Narrative** – Make decisions that shape the story outcome.  
- 🎨 **Interactive Drawing** – Personalize the experience with a "Draw Your Own Auggie" feature.  
- 🎮 **Emotion Adventure Game** – Enhance emotional intelligence with interactive activities.  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (VanillaJS, Tailwind CSS)**  
- **Canvas API** for drawing interactions  
- **Interactive UI components** for engaging user experience  

## 🎮 How It Works  
1. **Read & Compare**: View the story from multiple character perspectives side by side.  
2. **Tag Emotions**: Drag emojis onto text to express how a character might feel.  
3. **Reflect & Respond**: Answer embedded reflection prompts that encourage deeper thinking.  
4. **Make Choices**: Decide how characters respond in the story and watch outcomes unfold.  
5. **Draw & Personalize**: Use the built-in drawing tool to create your own version of Auggie.
